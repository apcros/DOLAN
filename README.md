Dirty Operational & Light Administration Nest , or D.O.L.A.N 

It's an administration page orginally developped for monitoring my SunFire v20z.

It's a quick'n'dirty code.

	- For getting the SSH commands working, you'll need to add the public RSA key of the webserver
	 in the distant server

	- Some commands will obviously not work on regular computers (Like 'sensor get') but 
	the comments in monitor.php indicates their "regular" equivalent

The UI is made with the Twitter Bootstrap.

You can add DOLAN as a web app using the Chrome Beta on android.
